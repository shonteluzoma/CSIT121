<p>Welcome to my webpage! At first this task seemed like a lot <br> but once you start to get in the groove of things it's really not that bad. <br> Having the basic understanding of how to structure HTML is important <br> in teaching you how webpages are built. Once you know your tags and <br>structures and work on your precision while typing to avoid errors, it should <br> be smooth sailing from there. </p>
<h3>What I Learned...</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Attention to detail is key, always check for errors and typos.</li>
    <li>Use attributes like id, class, alt, and href properly for styling, accessibility, and navigation.</li>
<li>Use helpful shortcuts the system provides like typing HTML:5 in the begining of your code to give you the correct layout you need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning about the history of the internet from module 01 and structuring with HTML from module 02 was fun. I really enjoyed reading from the websites the modules provided for us. Here are two informative sites linked below that aided me in creating this blog post.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Things that I learned since Module 02 for Module 03</h3>
<ol>
    <li>CSS lets you pick which HTML elements to style using selectors.</li>
    <li>When multiple rules apply to an element, specificity determines which one takes effect. ID selectors have the highest priority, next are class selectors, and then type selectors.</li>
<li>Type selectors, ID selectors, and class selectors are the most popular. I used the last two in this webpage.</li>
</ol>
<p> Learning about CSS was fun. It really enhances a webpage visually and bring life to the html. I also love how we can link it to our html externally because it makes everything way more organized that way. I really enjoyed reading from the websites the modules provided for us. Here are two informative sites linked below that aided me in creating the second half of this blog post.</p>
