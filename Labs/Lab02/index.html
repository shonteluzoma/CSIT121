<p>Welcome to my webpage! At first this task seemed like a lot <br> but once you start to get in the groove of things it's really not that bad. <br> Having the basic understanding of how to structure HTML is important <br> in teaching you how webpages are built. Once you know your tags and <br>structures and work on your precision while typing to avoid errors, it should <br> be smooth sailing from there. </p>
<h3>What I Learned...</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Attention to detail is key, always check for errors and typos.</li>
    <li>Use attributes like id, class, alt, and href properly for styling, accessibility, and navigation.</li>
<li>Use helpful shortcuts the system provides like typing HTML:5 in the begining of your code to give you the correct layout you need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning about the history of the internet from module 01 and structuring with HTML from module 02 was fun. I really enjoyed reading from the websites the modules provided for us. Here are two informative sites linked below that aided me in creating this blog post.</p>
